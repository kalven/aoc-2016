## Advent of Code 2016 solutions

These are my solutions for Advent of Code 2016. All should compile with a recent
GCC without any particular flags (though, -O3 will be nice for some
problems). Solutions for day 19 & 20 use boost, all other days get by with the
standard library only.

I was going for leaderboard placement on most days. This means the code was
written with these priorities:

 * Fast development.

 * If the problem called for it, fast runtime.

 * ...

 * ...

 * ... elegance?
